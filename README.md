# Devfolify
Welcome to **Devfolify**! Our project submission for the [**Illuminate Hackathon**](https://illuminatehackathon.org).

## Overview üåü

Devfolify is a full stack application designed to provide personalized coding challenges. Our goal is to move beyond the traditional lists of beginner or advanced projects and offer unique, skill-level tailored challenges that encourage creativity and problem-solving. This approach not only helps you develop new projects and skills but also fosters real-world problem-solving abilities, and perhaps even that idea of a lifetime that could take you to great places! üåü

Now the main premise and idea behind this app, although not fully built yet, is that people will be able to make these challenges or post ones themselves for others to participate in. Somewhat like a mini hackathon but on everyones own time and with a public leaderboard, individual stats, a place to discover other peoples projects, and even maybe a section with coding articles from [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/). But not only that, it encourages people to instead of just building a premade project, find a solution to a real world issue with creativity and code.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Personalized Challenges**: Utilizing our refined algorithm to provide tailored challenges to your skill level.
- **Express.js Backend**: A robust REST API built with Express.js.
- **Gemini Pro Integration**: Leveraging Gemini Pro to return results based on our algorithmically generated prompts.
- **Nuxt.js Frontend**: A modern (sorta... it was rushed) frontend designed with Nuxt.js. (mobile is NOT supported at the time)
- **Optimized Render Times**: With Nuxt.js and Nitro (it's server engine) I was able to improve the page navigation speed by around 60% alongside the challenge generation times.
- **TailwindCSS Styling**: Sleek and simple UI using TailwindCSS.
- - **DaisyUI Components**: TailwindCSS powered components for smaller elements like buttons and loading animations.
- **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) Authentication**: Secure user authentication implemented with self-hosted Appwrite.
- **Docker Support**: Full Docker support with Docker Compose and Dockerfiles for easy self-hosting.
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Alongside this app being fully up on the web at [devfolify.com](https://devfolify.com), there's also 24/7 [monitoring](https://uptime.zachl.tech/status/devfolify) to make sure services don't go down

## TODO/Isssues

Sadly we weren't able to get a database implemented in time so there won't be a social aspect to this platform just yet or any way to go back and view your past challenges to work on which is sad but it will soon be there as I'll continue to work on this after Illuminate! I also wasn't able to implement submitting your projects either sadly due to this time bottleneck

We also had many more plans to add to the dashboard UI but simply couldn't as a core team members WiFi was out during almost all of the hackathon (Saturday).

*You will also see throughout the UI some grayed out elements meaning they aren't a developed feature yet and were planned to be completed but it simply didn't happen*

## Developing Devfolify üöÄ

To get started with Devfolify, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites üìã

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

In both the `/frontend/app` and `/backend/app` folders you'll find a `.env.sample` file. This is where you add your environment variables to make this app fully work on your maching.

#### Environment variables include your:

##### Frontend

- [Appwrite Endpoint](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account)
- [Appwrite Project ID](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/quick-start)

##### Backend

- REST API Port
- [Gemini Pro API Key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)


### Installation üîß

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devfolify.git
    cd devfolify
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cd backend/app/
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend/app/
    npm install
    ```

3. **Develop as you please and run the test environment**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    cd ../backend/app
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Or just run with Docker Compose in the root directory to test changes**:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

5. **Access the application**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend or your configured location for the backend.

    And if you're running with docker, the configured ports are `9986` for the backend and `9987` for the frontend

## Usage üíª

Once the application is up and running, you can:

1. **Sign up / Log in**: Use Appwrite authentication to create an account or log in.
2. **Receive Challenges**: Based on your skill level, receive unique coding challenges.
3. **Submit Solutions**: Work on the challenges and submit your solutions.
4. **Track Progress**: Keep track of your progress and enhance your skills with each challenge.

## Contributing ü§ù

We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows our coding conventions and passes all tests.
