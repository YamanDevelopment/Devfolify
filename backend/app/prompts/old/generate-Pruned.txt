I want you to act as a project advisor for individuals in the tech industry. Based on the answers to the following questions, generate a list of problems in various tech fields, including specific example scenarios for each problem. Provide the information in JSON format. The JSON structure should include the following keys: "field", "description", "example_scenarios", "target_level", "areas_of_interest", "suggested_languages", and "suggested_tools". Make sure the example scenarios are detailed and specific to subsets of the broad problem described. Here are the questions:

What is your current level of coding knowledge? (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
What are your primary areas of interest in technology? (Web development, Data science, Cybersecurity, Game development, Machine learning, etc.)
OPTIONAL - What are your career goals in the tech industry?
Which programming languages are you familiar with? (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
OPTIONAL - Are you looking to learn a specific programming language? If so, which one?
What type of projects are you interested in working on?
Are there any specific technologies or tools you want to learn? (e.g., Git, Docker, AWS)
Do you have any time constraints or deadlines for achieving your learning goals?
Are you interested in joining a community or forum to support your learning journey?
What type of assessments do you prefer to measure your progress? (Quizzes, Projects, Peer reviews)
Are you looking for mentorship or guidance from experienced professionals?
What is your ultimate goal after completing the learning path? (Job placement, Start a project, Build a portfolio, etc.)
Have you completed any coding challenges or competitions? If so, please specify.
Do you have any accessibility needs or preferences for learning materials?

Example JSON output:

{
  "problem":
    {
      "field": "x",
      "description": "General problem",
      "example_scenarios": [
        {
          "scenario": "Specific example",
          "possible_solutions": ["1", "2"]
        },
        {
          "scenario": "Specific example",
          "possible_solutions": ["1", "2"]
        }
      ],
      "target_level": "x to y",
      "areas_of_interest": ["x"],
      "suggested_languages": ["x"],
      "suggested_tools": ["1", "2", "3"]
    }
}

Remember that inside each "scenario" key is supposed to be a specific real world problem (whether it's real or not) which is directly under the same topic as what's in the "description" key. each scenario should ONLY have examples of a general problem which lights the path to a possible solution
Generate the JSON output with a SINGLE problem by considering the answer provided to these questions, tailoring the problems and scenarios to match the individual's background, interests, and goals. DO NOT give me anything other than just the JSON

ok now instead of explicit projects to do, give me problems in the general field revolving around the answers to the questions for the person reading your response to deduce their own solution and project ideas from

Here is an example of what a generated response looked like in the past. DO NOT COPY THIS RESPONSE, but make a different version of it with different JSON key values.

{
    "problem": {
        "field": "Web Development",
        "description": "Many small businesses lack an online presence, resulting in missed opportunities for growth and customer engagement.",
        "example_scenarios": [
        {
            "scenario": "A local bakery wants to attract more customers by showcasing their products online but has no website.",
            "possible_solutions": ["Create an e-commerce site for the bakery", "Develop a portfolio-style website to display their offerings"]
        },
        {
            "scenario": "A freelance graphic designer needs an online portfolio to display their work and attract clients.",
            "possible_solutions": ["Design a personal portfolio site", "Integrate a blog to share design insights and case studies"]
        }
        ],
        "target_level": "Beginner to Intermediate",
        "areas_of_interest": ["Web development"],
        "suggested_languages": ["JavaScript"],
        "suggested_tools": ["HTML", "CSS", "Git"]
    }
}
