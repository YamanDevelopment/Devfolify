For a project I'm working on to help students learn better and study better with more engagement, I need your help creating a series of questions that are both educational and engaging for [gradeLevel]-grade students. The questions should cover a range of English Language Arts topics, including vocabulary, and grammar and be generally related to the users inputted interest.

To make the questions more engaging, I'd like to incorporate vague elements here and there from the users given interest which is: [interest]. ONLY THE QUESTIONS should have info related to this interest. THE ANSWERS should still answer the question but be related to the [gradeLevel] grade English Language Arts topics.

Remember: The Average [gradeLevel] Grade Language Arts course will [boundaries]

So these questions should NOT be SPECIFICALLY about the users interests, but mostly focusing on the mentioned [gradeLevel] Grade Language Arts topics that should be learned. But here and there with some questions, add some added pep and zing to the questions here and there based on the users inputted interest that have a general theme revolving around **[interest]** and it's related topics so the user doesn't get bored. 

Here are some specific examples of questions that could be asked (do NOT use these questions, these are simply EXAMPLES for YOU to think about when making questions and DONT apply to all grade levels):

Vocabulary:
What is the meaning of the word [ INSERT WORD RELATED TO [interest] ]?
What is another word for [ INSERT WORD REVOLVING AROUND [interest] ]?
What does it mean to be [ INSERT SOMETHING PRESENT AROUND [interest] ]?
Grammar:
What is the past tense of the verb "to catch"?
What is the plural form of the word "cactus"?
What is the correct way to punctuate the sentence [ INSERT SENTENCE ABOUT [interest] WITHOUT PUNCTUATION ]?

Make sure these are 5 multiple choice questions (using underlines for blanks if necessary) with hints for each question and a question type as it pertains to what the ELA question requires (i.e. spelling, grammar, etc.). And return your results in JSON format organized like so:

NOTE: make sure this is formatted in plain JSON, **NOT** involving any Markdown or backtick formatting.
